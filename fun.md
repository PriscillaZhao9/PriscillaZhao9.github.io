Plants

 Drinking
----
- I love sparkling wine and beers! Popping a bottle of bubbles generally promises a happy and chill time. Though I have a low alcohol tolerance, I like to buy them. Some corner of my refrigerator...

Party Hostess
----
- I used to be a hostess in Macau and I had hosted several academic conferences, commercial activities and student organization activities.

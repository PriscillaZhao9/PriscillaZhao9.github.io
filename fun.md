Drinking
----
- I love sparkling wine and beers! Popping a bottle of bubbles generally promises a happy and chill time. Though I have a low alcohol tolerance, I like to buy them. 

Plants
---- 
- I've been in the “give me a houseplant and I will definitely kill it” camp, but I still believe I will be a awesome gardener for my green friends.

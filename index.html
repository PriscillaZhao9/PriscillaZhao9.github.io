Hiiii! My name is Priscilla(Pu) Zhao (Chinese: 赵普). I am a first year <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/eds">Education Data Science Master</a> student at <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/">Stanford Graduate School of Education</a> working with <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/jelenao">Professor Jelena Obradović </a>in the <a href="https://sparklab.stanford.edu/">Spark Lab </a>and <a href="http://markwarschauer.com/">Professor Mark Warschauer </a>in the <a href="https://www.digitallearninglab.org/">Digital Learning Lab</a>. My research mainly focuses on early childhood development, specifically using artificial intelligence systems to mimic and promote children’s curiosity and designing technologies to support language and literacy development. I am also interested in children's psychology and developing effective interventions to support children’s functioning in relationships, socioemotional development, well-being, and academic performances.

Before joining Stanford, I got my bachelor's degree in Pure Math and Communication & Media Studies from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I worked on Michigan early childhood policy analysis in Education Policy Initiative(PI: Brian Jacob and Gloria Yeomans-Maldonado), gameful learning analysis of GradeCraft (PI: Barry Fishman) and Google image search algorithm biases analysis in Center for Ethics, Society and Computing (PI: Christian Sandvig).

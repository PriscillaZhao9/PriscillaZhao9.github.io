I am a second year <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/eds">Education Data Science Master</a> student at <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/">Stanford Graduate School of Education</a>. I am fortunate to have professors <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/philf">Phil Fisher</a>, <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber">Nick Haber</a>, <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/roypea">Roy Pea</a>, and <a href="http://markwarschauer.com/">Mark Warschauer</a> as my advisors. My research focuses on the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence to promote positive parent-child interactions (Project: <a href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/innovation-application/innovation-in-action/find/">Filming Interactions to Nurture Development</a>). Additionally, I am interested in using innovative technologies, such as large language models, to enhance STEM learning (Project: MathyAI) and improve the well-being of caregivers. My ultimate goal is to empower young learners to reach their full potential and improve their lives through learning.

Before joining Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree with a double major in <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/pure-mathematics.html">Pure Mathematics </a>and <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/comm">Communication & Media </a>from the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>. I worked on Michigan early childhood policy analysis in the<a href="https://edpolicy.umich.edu/"> Education Policy Initiative</a> (PI:<a href="http://www.brian-jacob.com//"> Professor Brian Jacob </a> and <a href="https://med.uth.edu/pediatrics/faculty/gloria-yeomans-maldonado-phd/">Professor Gloria Yeomans-Maldonado</a>), gameful learning analysis of <a href="https://gradecraft.com/">GradeCraft </a> (PI: <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/barry-fishman">Professor Barry Fishman</a>) and Google image search algorithm biases analysis in the<a href="https://esc.umich.edu/"> Center for Ethics, Society and Computing</a> (PI:  <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/">Professor Christian Sandvig</a>).

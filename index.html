Hiiii! My name is Priscilla(Pu) Zhao (Chinese:赵普). I am a first year Education Data Science Master student at Stanford Graduate School of Education working with Jelena Obradović in the Spark Lab and Mark Warschauer in the Digital Learning Lab. My research mainly focuses on early childhood development, specifically on using artificial intelligence systems to mimic and promote children’s curiosity and designing technologies, e.g. conversational agents, to support language and literacy development. I am also interested in children's psychology and developing effective interventions to support children’s functioning in relationships, socioemotional development, well-being, and academic performances.

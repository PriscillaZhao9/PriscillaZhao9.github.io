I am a first year <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/eds">Education Data Science Master</a> student at <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/">Stanford Graduate School of Education</a> working with <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/jelenao">Professor Jelena Obradović </a> in the <a href="https://sparklab.stanford.edu/">Spark Lab </a> and <a href="http://markwarschauer.com/">Professor Mark Warschauer </a>in the <a href="https://www.digitallearninglab.org/"> Digital Learning Lab </a>. My research mainly focuses on early childhood development, specifically using artificial intelligence systems to mimic and promote children’s curiosity and designing technologies to support language and literacy development. I am also interested in children's psychology and developing effective interventions to support children’s functioning in relationships, socioemotional development, well-being, and academic performances.
